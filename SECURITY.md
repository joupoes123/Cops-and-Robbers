## Security Improvements in Version 2.0

Version **1.2.0** includes several important security enhancements:

- **Input Validation**: Improved validation of all player inputs to prevent exploits, injections, and unauthorized access.
- **Admin Command Security**: Ensured that all admin commands have consistent security checks and proper input validation to prevent misuse.
- **Data Handling Optimization**: Enhanced data structures and handling procedures to prevent data leaks and ensure the integrity of player data.
- **Function Definition Corrections**: Resolved issues related to function scopes and definitions to prevent potential script errors and vulnerabilities.

## Security Recommendations

To help secure your server and player data:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to FiveM, GTA V, and this game mode. Staying current helps protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For GitHub accounts, server control panels, and any other accounts that can access the server or repository.
- **Restrict Admin Access**: Limit the number of users with admin permissions within the game mode to reduce the risk of insider threats. Ensure that admin identifiers are securely managed in `admin.lua`.
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of your server data to prevent data loss and to enable recovery in case of a security breach.
- **Monitor Server Logs**: Regularly monitor server logs for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Secure Communication Channels**: Use encrypted connections (e.g., SSL/TLS) for any remote server management tools or databases.

For additional guidance, refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/Indom-hub/Cops-and-Robbers/wiki) and [installation guide](https://github.com/Indom-hub/Cops-and-Robbers).
