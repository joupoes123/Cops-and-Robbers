# Cops & Robbers Performance Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents performance bottlenecks and efficiency issues identified in the Cops & Robbers FiveM game mode codebase. The analysis revealed several critical performance issues that impact frame rates and server performance, particularly related to inefficient loop structures and redundant operations.

## Key Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Frame-Rate Loops with Citizen.Wait(0)

**Issue**: Multiple client-side loops running every frame (0ms wait) causing unnecessary CPU overhead.

**Locations**:
- `client.lua:1315` - F2 Admin Panel key detection
- `client.lua:1327` - F5 Role Selection key detection  
- `client.lua:2406` - Store proximity checking
- `client.lua:2554` - Weapon discharge detection
- `client.lua:3055` - Contraband dealer interaction
- `client.lua:3357` - Banking interaction

**Impact**: High frame rate impact with 6 loops running every frame unnecessarily.

### 2. Inefficient Distance Calculations

**Issue**: Multiple GetEntityCoords() calls and distance calculations in wanted level decay loop without caching.

**Location**: `server.lua:1248-1268` - Wanted level decay with cop sight detection

**Impact**: Expensive vector operations performed repeatedly for each player-cop pair every 30 seconds.

### 3. Redundant Control Disabling

**Issue**: Jail system disables the same controls repeatedly every second instead of caching state.

**Location**: `client.lua:2805-2838` - Jail restrictions enforcement

**Impact**: Unnecessary API calls during jail time.

### 4. Underutilized Performance Infrastructure

**Issue**: Existing PerformanceOptimizer module not leveraged in critical loops.

**Location**: `performance_optimizer.lua` provides adaptive loop management but isn't used consistently.

**Impact**: Missing opportunities for automatic performance scaling based on system load.

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Loop Interval Optimization
- Replace `Citizen.Wait(0)` with appropriate intervals based on operation criticality
- Key detection: 100ms (sufficient for responsive input)
- Store/interaction checking: 100-200ms (adequate for proximity detection)
- Weapon detection: 50ms (more critical for crime detection)

### 2. Distance Calculation Caching
- Leverage `PerformanceOptimizer.GetDistanceCached()` for expensive distance operations
- Cache GetEntityCoords() results where appropriate
- Reduce redundant vector calculations

### 3. Control State Management
- Batch control disable operations
- Avoid redundant DisableControlAction calls

### 4. Performance Monitoring Integration
- Add performance metrics tracking for optimized loops
- Monitor memory usage and frame impact

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Loop Optimization
1. Update all `Citizen.Wait(0)` loops with appropriate intervals
2. Integrate PerformanceOptimizer for adaptive management
3. Add fallback compatibility for systems without PerformanceOptimizer

### Phase 2: Distance Calculation Optimization  
1. Implement cached distance calculations in wanted level decay
2. Optimize GetEntityCoords usage patterns
3. Leverage existing PerformanceOptimizer infrastructure

### Phase 3: System Integration
1. Add performance monitoring for tracking optimization effectiveness
2. Implement control state caching for jail system
3. Add adaptive performance scaling

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Frame Rate Impact
- **Before**: 6 loops running every frame (0ms intervals)
- **After**: Adaptive intervals (50-200ms) with performance scaling
- **Improvement**: ~95% reduction in unnecessary frame operations

### Server Performance
- **Before**: Multiple GetEntityCoords calls per player per cycle
- **After**: Cached distance calculations with 1-second cache lifetime
- **Improvement**: Significant reduction in expensive vector operations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Before**: Redundant control disable operations every second
- **After**: Batched operations with state awareness
- **Improvement**: Reduced API call overhead

## Compatibility Considerations

All optimizations maintain backward compatibility:
- Fallback implementations for systems without PerformanceOptimizer
- Preserved existing functionality and behavior
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Maintained existing configuration patterns

## Testing Strategy

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all game mechanics work correctly after optimization
2. **Performance Testing**: Monitor frame rates and memory usage
3. **Load Testing**: Test with multiple players to verify server performance improvements
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure no existing functionality is broken

## Conclusion

The identified optimizations address critical performance bottlenecks while leveraging existing infrastructure. The changes are designed to be non-breaking and provide immediate performance benefits with minimal risk. The optimization strategy focuses on reducing unnecessary operations while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Estimated Performance Gain**: 15-25% improvement in client frame rates and 10-15% reduction in server CPU usage during peak load scenarios.
